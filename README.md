# Crowdfunded Delivery for Good

Our idea was to better connect people in need(or those representing them) and those who can help. More concretely, we try to match a surplus of a resource, which is soon to go to waste if not used, to those who really need it but cannot afford it. An example: Matching surplus of good food from restaurants, events etc. with shelters while providing a good delivery experience(a couple alternative ways to choose from). We do realize this problem has been attempted before. We believed our additions to solve this problem and approach to the delivery was worth pursuing.

Restaurants(sources) while signing up provide basic information with their location. If they have a surplus they are willing to donate, they can post that on our app, which will require additional information such as quantity (the units are yet to be determined; for now it is the headcount for which this the surplus is good for) , an expiry date, if they are willing to donate for delivery or if they can deliver it themselves. We use this information to match with a nearby in-need group.

Options for delivery:

1.  If the restaurant or a representative from the in-need group can pick it up, we provide the information they need and leave it up to them.
2. If the restaurant wants to donate to cover the delivery charge we could arrange for a delivery service.
3. We plan to implement a volunteer sign up form, and we can help connect the restaurants to the volunteers that are willing to deliver within a reasonable radius.
4. However, the crux of solving the delivery problem is to use crowdfunded resources to pay for delivery.

While we are still far from fleshing out the details and a lot left to be accounted for, we have a bare bores skeleton up hopefully being able to demonstrate a portion of our idea, albeit small.
